# Backlog

packetcode is pre-1.0. This file contains only work that has not shipped; completed work belongs in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Several items below came from reading two upstream agents against this tree.
[`docs/research/upstream-adoption-plan.md`](docs/research/upstream-adoption-plan.md)
carries the evidence, effort, risk, and sequencing, plus the list of things
deliberately **not** taken and why; the per-upstream notes are
[`upstream-opencode.md`](docs/research/upstream-opencode.md) and
[`upstream-crush.md`](docs/research/upstream-crush.md). crush is FSL-licensed
and packetcode competes with it, so those documents are written as clean-room
specifications: implement from them with the upstream source closed, and never
copy its code or prompt text.

## v1 Release Readiness

- ~~Add a bounded non-interactive execution surface:~~ **Shipped 2026-08-31.**
  `packetcode run [--provider P] [--model M] [--permission-mode MODE]
  [--resume ID] [--json] <prompt...>` runs one agent turn through the runtime
  builder now shared with the TUI and ACP server. It accepts no stdin prompt,
  trust/computer shortcut, or ephemeral-session mode. An unavailable approval
  fails closed with exit 3; cancellation exits 130. Plain mode writes only the
  sanitized final response. JSON is one `schema_version: 1` document carrying
  `ok`, session/provider/model identity, output, elapsed milliseconds, usage
  (including cache subsets), and an error when applicable. The command has
  focused contract tests plus build/CI help smoke coverage.
- ~~Benchmark `packetcode run` against the ACP harness with identical provider,
  model, prompt, and permission policy.~~ **Completed 2026-09-01.** The
  [controlled result](docs/benchmarks/run-vs-acp-2026-09-01.md) matched output,
  provider calls, tool calls, input/output tokens, and zero approvals. Median
  wall time differed by only 3%, with ACP slightly faster; live-provider
  variance was much larger. There is no residual ACP penalty to optimize and
  no evidence yet that public phase observability is warranted.
- ~~Automate signed/notarized macOS, Linux, and Windows release artifacts and
  checksum verification.~~ **Mostly shipped 2026-08-30.** See
  [docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md).
  Done and verifiable today: Sigstore keyless signing of `checksums.txt` (the
  missing half — both installers verified an archive *against* a checksum file
  that nothing established as ours, so the check was circular); SLSA build
  provenance attestation; reproducible builds via `mod_timestamp`; signature
  verification in `install.sh` and `install.ps1`, which refuse outright on a
  present-but-invalid signature and never soften it into "unsigned"; and a
  release dry run on every push that builds all six archives and asserts them,
  so the pipeline is no longer first exercised by tagging.
  Wired but dormant, because both need certificates that must be bought: Apple
  Developer ID + notarization (GoReleaser OSS, runs on the Linux runner — this
  needs no Mac) and Windows Authenticode via `osslsigncode`. Both are gated on
  their secrets, the job summary states which ran, and the repository variable
  `REQUIRE_SIGNING=1` turns a skip into a failed release once the certificates
  exist. **What remains is a purchase, not code**: an Apple Developer account
  (99 USD/yr) and a Windows code-signing certificate. Neither signing path has
  been executed end to end against a real certificate — the Authenticode script
  was tested against a self-signed one, which signs and timestamps correctly and
  fails chain validation exactly as it should.
- ~~Define compatibility and migration policy for config, sessions, persisted
  jobs, workflow TOML, and MCP definitions.~~ **Shipped 2026-08-30** as
  [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md), with `internal/compat` as its
  executable form and a doc test that fails when the two disagree — a published
  contract that can drift from the code silently is a document, not a contract.
  The policy was previously spelled six different ways by six packages, which is
  why writing it down found bugs. Sessions carried a `format_version` and
  enforced nothing: a newer session decoded cleanly, `migrateSession` saw a
  version above its own and did nothing, and the next message saved it back with
  every unknown field stripped — silent, permanent data loss in a file the user
  never touched. Sessions now refuse a newer version at load, at listing, and at
  the write chokepoint. Config had no version at all and ignored unrecognised
  keys in silence; it now carries an optional `schema_version` and names what it
  did not understand, at startup and in `doctor`.
  MCP definitions turned out not to be a separate format — they live in
  `config.toml` under `[mcp.<name>]` and are covered by its row.
  Config is deliberately the one format that reports rather than refuses: it is
  a file a person typed, packetcode never rewrites it, so there is nothing to
  corrupt, and refusing to start over it would be a worse failure than the one
  prevented.
  This was the item flagged to land before any daemon work. It has.
- ~~Surface unreadable job records.~~ **Shipped 2026-08-14** with PCMP10, which
  made it urgent: an older build meeting the new `abandoned` state rejects the
  record, so without this the job simply vanished from the UI. Startup now warns
  on stderr alongside the recovered count, and `doctor` gained the
  `state.jobs.records` check. Both bound their per-record listing to 3 so a
  corrupt directory cannot flood the terminal, and both go through the new
  read-only `jobs.InspectRecords` — `NewManager` reconciles and rewrites
  records, so a diagnostic built on it would have marked a live instance's
  in-flight jobs abandoned just by being run.
- Add end-to-end smoke coverage for first-run setup, provider switching, session resume, approvals, background jobs, workflows, and MCP.
- Keep provider catalogs, pricing, context windows, and tool-capability metadata
  current; prefer live discovery when authoritative. **Decided 2026-08-14: fetch
  models.dev with stdlib, do not import `charm.land/catwalk`.** Catwalk declares
  `go 1.26.6` against this repo's 1.24.2, pulls prometheus and protobuf for what
  is 70 lines of stdlib HTTP, has no `mistral` entry, prices MiniMax-M3 at the
  long-context tier, and has no tiered-pricing field at all — so it structurally
  cannot express the MiniMax billing item below. models.dev carries the tiers
  and cached rates verbatim. Ship a trimmed embedded snapshot as the offline
  fallback (~150 KB) so the single-binary property holds and startup never
  blocks on the network; precedence is user config > live catalog > snapshot >
  today's hand tables.
- Add opt-in live-provider contract tests that never run in ordinary CI.
  **Decided 2026-08-14: own the recorder** (~300-LOC `http.RoundTripper` plus
  JSON cassettes) rather than importing `charm.land/x/vcr` or `dnaeon/go-vcr` —
  the requirement is SSE frame chronology with controllable inter-frame timing
  so `StallGuard` is exercised, which a generic HTTP recorder does not give.
  Record on an env flag, replay always, and **fail on a missing cassette when
  `CI=true`**; without that rule cassettes silently re-record drift and assert
  nothing. Allow-list headers on write and test that the scrubber ran — a key
  committed inside a cassette is unrecoverable once pushed. Extend the existing
  `CODEX_LIVE=1` convention rather than inventing a second harness.
- ~~`TestDoctorPlainOutputDoesNotLeakSecrets` fails from environment
  contamination.~~ **Fixed 2026-08-26.** An ambient `OLLAMA_HOST` outranked the
  planted config, so the redaction assertion never saw the string it checks and
  the test guarded nothing. `isolateDoctorEnv` now clears the vendor variables
  too, not just the `PACKETCODE_` ones; `CODEX_HOME` had the same shape and was
  breaking two further doctor tests on any machine using Codex.
- ~~`TestManager_TranscriptReadsLiveSubSessionWhileRunning` is flaky against its
  60s deadline, and it is not alone.~~ **Fixed 2026-08-26** in `73a4c35`;
  the entry went unstruck until 2026-08-30. `internal/testwait` scales every
  async deadline by `PACKETCODE_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE` (default x10) and logs a
  slow pass rather than failing it, so a loaded machine and a regression are no
  longer the same result. Wired into `internal/jobs`, `internal/mcp` and the
  `internal/app` job tests.

## Review findings 2026-08-25 — verified, not yet fixed

From a package-by-package review pass. Each was confirmed against the code;
they were left unfixed for the reason given, not for lack of a diagnosis.

- ~~Agent View and workflow rows truncated mid-ANSI-escape.~~ **Fixed
  2026-08-27.** Both views sized columns with `lipgloss.Width` and then clipped
  with a rune counter, so ~15-20 runes of invisible SGR escape per styled
  segment cut rows far short — visibly, at ~35 of 100 columns, with the age
  column never rendering. Both `truncate` helpers now measure display width via
  `ansi.Truncate`, which also fixes wide-rune under-measurement. Guarded by a
  unit test using literal escapes, because lipgloss emits none without a TTY.
- ~~The TUI goldens were stale for 25 days.~~ **Closed 2026-08-30.** Last
  regenerated 2026-08-01; `targetLabel` entered the Agent View detail line on
  2026-08-02, so `make tui-golden-check` — and CI's `tui-golden` job — had been
  failing on `main` since then, unrelated to any later change. Regenerated
  2026-08-27, and re-verified against a fresh build on 2026-08-30 rather than
  taking the earlier note's word for it: `TUI goldens match`.
  The harness refuses to run off POSIX (`scripts/tui_capture.py:207`), so
  checking this from Windows means a cross-compiled Linux binary plus a
  throwaway `python:3.13-slim` container with `pyte` — nothing installed on the
  host. Two things bite on that path and are worth knowing before the next
  person spends an hour on them: Git Bash rewrites `-w /w` into a Windows path
  unless `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` is set, and `scripts/tui_golden.sh` has CRLF
  endings in the working tree, which `dash` rejects with `set: Illegal option -`
  until the script is passed through `sed 's/
$//'`.
- ~~A self-paced `/loop` started during a streaming turn never advances.~~
  **Fixed 2026-08-30.** `runLoopBody`'s streaming guard sat before
  `a.activeLoopID = ls.id`, so the loop registered, listed forever, and did
  nothing. The diagnosis named the fix -- re-attach ownership to the queued
  turn -- and that is what landed: `turnOptions`/`queuedInput` carry a
  `loopID`, claimed when the turn actually starts rather than when it is
  created. The guard also skipped the iteration instruction, so the queued body
  was bare text with no way for the model to declare the work finished; the
  turn is now built once, before the branch, and the queued and immediate paths
  consume the same value.
- ~~`formatTerminalJobLine` drops the artifacts line.~~ **Fixed 2026-08-30.**
  The early `return head` inside the empty-body branch sat above the
  `jobs.ArtifactDigest` block, so a job that finished with artifacts and
  nothing else lost the one line naming what it produced — and the `/agents`
  pointer for reading it — precisely for the jobs whose only output was
  artifacts. Every part is now gathered before anything decides the line is
  empty, which is how the sibling `formatAgentPeek` was already written and why
  it never had this bug.
- ~~MCP death reason can report EOF instead of the real exit status.~~
  **Fixed 2026-08-30.** The contract this was waiting on turned out not to need
  the lifecycle reordering the diagnosis feared. Liveness and cause are two
  facts that were sharing one atomic: `dead` has to flip the instant the reader
  sees stdout close, because that is what unblocks callers stuck in `write()`,
  while the cause is not known until `cmd.Wait` returns. Nothing about that
  ordering changed — the reader simply stopped claiming to know why. With a
  child still to reap it records the bare sentinel, and the reaper replaces it
  with the exit status. `DeathReasonWithin` waits for the reap for callers that
  want the status, and the diagnostics use it.
- ~~Provider SSE parsers send on an unguarded channel.~~ **Fixed 2026-08-30.**
  Sixty-nine bare sends across five parsers now go through `provider.StreamSink`,
  which selects on the turn's context. The point was to make the guarantee
  structural rather than repeat a select at every site: a parser cannot send
  without going through the sink, and the sink cannot send without observing
  cancellation.
  Narrower than it looked, and in an instructive way. Each parser already
  re-checks cancellation at the top of its scanner loop, so a consumer that
  cancelled *and then drained* was always safe — the drain releases the send
  and the next iteration bails. The reachable gap was a consumer that cancels
  and never drains again: the send never returns, the loop never reaches its
  check, and the goroutine holds the response body and stall guard forever.
  The regression test therefore never receives after cancelling and asserts on
  the goroutine, because observing a channel close means receiving from it,
  which is the one thing that hides the bug.
- ~~`agent.ToolDecider` / `DecideTool` is a half-wired interface.~~
  **Removed 2026-08-30.** The question was which half was dead, and the answer
  is both: `git log -S` shows no commit in the history ever type-asserted to
  `ToolDecider` or called `DecideTool` from the agent. The commit that
  introduced the interface (`d57a944`) also gave the agent its own
  `policy.Decide` consult, so the seam was superseded on the day it was
  written. The two would have applied the same policy to the same request.
  The one behavioural difference was a red herring: `DecideTool` strips the
  `[job:<id>]` prefix from a tool name and the agent does not. That prefix is
  added by the jobs approver when it forwards to the parent TUI approver, so it
  only ever exists inside `uiApprover` — which is where the stripping already
  lives. No agent-side gap.
  Deleting dead code should not quietly delete a guarantee, so the property the
  seam appeared to protect is now pinned: a deny rule blocks a tool whose
  `RequiresApproval` is false. If the policy were only consulted on the
  approval path that could not work, and the test fails if the agent's own
  consult is removed.
- ~~Session persistence.~~ **Fixed 2026-08-30.** All three, including the part
  held back as a repo-wide decision.
  `New` and `Load` returned the manager's own `*Session` while `Current`
  cloned, so a caller could mutate mutex-guarded state from outside the mutex —
  and `Save` writes whatever `m.current` points at, so the mutation would have
  silently persisted. Both now clone, matching `Current`. No caller was
  relying on the aliasing.
  `List` skipped unreadable files in silence, so a corrupt session vanished
  from `/resume` — indistinguishable from one that never existed, which is the
  wrong failure for the command whose whole job is finding a conversation the
  user knows they had. `ListWithProblems` reports them alongside, never instead
  of, the sessions that loaded; `/sessions` and `/resume` print them, bounded so
  a corrupt directory cannot flood the pane.
  The fsync gap is closed in both writers through a new `internal/atomicfile`.
  The decision it was waiting on came down to cost, and the cost is not there:
  a benchmark against the previous no-sync shape measures ~130µs on a small
  session file, about 6%, for a write that happens once a turn. Rename is
  atomic for a *reader*; without the sync it can reach the disk ahead of the
  bytes it names, so a crash leaves a file that exists, is correctly named, and
  is empty — the conversation for a session, and the state a restart
  reconciles from for a job record.
- ~~Several tests are timing-brittle under CPU load.~~ **Fixed 2026-08-30.**
  The deadlines were not wrong about *what* they waited for, only about how
  long that is allowed to take — and polling already returns the instant a
  condition holds, so a generous budget costs a fast machine nothing and is
  only spent when something is actually wrong. `internal/testwait` treats each
  call site's duration as a baseline and scales it (x10 by default,
  `PACKETCODE_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE` to override), so the literal still documents
  what the author expected while the budget reflects what a busy machine needs.
  The distinction the entry asked for is now made explicitly: a condition that
  holds later than its baseline logs one line saying the machine was slow and
  the test still passed, so slowness is visible without being reported as a
  regression.
  Evidence rather than assertion: `internal/jobs -count=6` previously failed
  and now passes; the full suite passes twice while a second package stress-run
  competes for the same cores. Shared package rather than three copies of the
  same helper, for the reason `provider.StreamSink` is shared — three copies of
  a convention drift.
## TUI and Interaction Parity

- Add transcript search/filter and a compact jump-to-latest affordance.
- Add queue reorder/edit controls; list, drop, and clear already ship.
- Improve visibility when cancellation is draining a provider or child process that has not exited yet.
- Add golden coverage for very tall approval/tool blocks.
- Continue comparing lifecycle states against Claude Code while preserving packetcode provider colors and multi-provider controls.
- Migrate to Bubble Tea v2 for enhanced keyboard reporting (including true
  Shift+Enter where supported) and synchronized-output rendering, preserving
  the committed inline/native-scrollback, no-mouse, and PTY safety contract.

## Context and Cost Efficiency

- Add provider-native token counting where a stable tokenizer/API exists; retain the conservative fallback estimator.
- Persist request-level occupancy samples for diagnostics without conflating them with billable totals.
- ~~Add configurable model-facing caps for search, command, MCP, and artifact
  output.~~ **Shipped 2026-09-03** as `internal/toolout`, at the chokepoint
  this entry identified: `handleToolCall`, after PostToolUse hooks, where
  native, MCP, and skill results all converge. Oversized output spills to disk
  and the model gets a head-and-tail excerpt naming the withheld byte range
  plus the `read_tool_output` call that retrieves it, so truncation stops
  meaning loss. Head alone was not enough — for a failing test run or a
  compiler dump the verdict is in the tail.
  The handle is an opaque random token resolved through an in-process map,
  never a path and never derived from model text; the model chooses that
  argument, so a path-shaped handle would have been an arbitrary file read
  straight through root confinement. Every miss — invented, malformed, pruned,
  evicted, or another session's — returns one indistinguishable "no longer
  retained" result, so nothing can be probed, and it degrades rather than
  erroring exactly as this entry required.
  One store per session on the todo-store precedent, a per-session budget with
  oldest-first eviction, removal on session end, and a startup prune so a
  killed process cannot orphan spill files. The 64 KiB session projection
  stays as the backstop for messages that never pass through the agent loop.
  Still open: `execute_command`'s own 100 KB cap still discards bytes before
  the store ever sees them, so raising or removing it is now safe and worth
  doing; and the per-tool count caps on `search_codebase`/`list_directory` are
  unchanged.
- Preserve/replay encrypted Codex reasoning items for multi-turn continuity if the subscription backend requires them; never attempt to display opaque reasoning.

## Agents, Loops, and Workflows

- Add explicit workflow pipeline stages beyond the current ordered
  phases/steps and step-level verifier/retry contract.
- Add a broader versioned example workflow library.
- **Ruled 2026-08-14: packetcode does not resume jobs across a restart.** Durable
  execution after the originating app closes belongs to PacketAgent, so PCMP9 is
  cut rather than deferred. An interrupted job can be explicitly re-run via
  `/jobs resubmit` (PCH4, 2026-07-31), which starts a new job and never claims
  the old process resumed. That remains the whole story; "jobs survive restart"
  must not be claimed by this repo at all. The honest reporting of an
  interrupted job is now carried by the `abandoned` state under Packet
  Computers, promoted from PCMP9 precondition to the primary terminal state and
  shipped 2026-08-14 as PCMP10.
- Let background agents request user clarification through Agent View. Routing
  half-exists: `jobApprover` already forwards to `uiApprover.PromptApproval`.
  **Two of the four obstacles were cleared 2026-09-03.** The approver is now a
  priority queue of id-bound envelopes rather than one slot, so a question can
  no longer head-of-line-block every approval from every job; and
  `Snapshot.AwaitingApproval`/`AwaitingAnswer`/`Blocked` give Agent View and
  the workflow view a distinct signal, rendered distinctly today.
  Two remain, and both are policy decisions rather than plumbing. Read-only
  jobs are still refused before reaching the parent approver, which is correct
  for a *tool* approval and wrong for a *question* — a read-only job is
  precisely the one that should be able to ask. And there is still no timeout,
  so a blocked question holds a slot out of `background_max_concurrent`
  indefinitely; the queue now drops an envelope whose context expires, so
  adding one is mechanical once someone picks the duration.
  One data bug to fix with it: `internal/jobs/worker.go` sets `NeedsInput` and
  `NeedsApproval` to the same value, so the accessors above are currently
  reading a field that never differs. The call site must set them
  independently when a question can actually be asked.
- Add optional live sub-agent transcript streaming without injecting it into foreground model context.
- Add safe worktree merge/apply assistance and explicit cleanup commands.

## Tools, Execution, and Code Intelligence

Most of this section came out of the upstream research in
[`docs/research/`](docs/research/upstream-adoption-plan.md); that plan carries
the evidence, effort, and risk for each item.

- Prune session backups. `internal/session/backup.go` copies the whole file on
  every write and never cleans up: the undo stack is in-memory only, so `.bak`
  files orphan on restart, `Cleanup()` has no production caller, and background
  jobs get their own manager whose backups are never cleaned and never reachable
  from `/undo`. Age-based prune plus a per-session byte cap.
- Add git shadow-repo snapshots for message-level revert. Separate `--git-dir`
  under the packetcode home with `--work-tree` at the project root, one commit
  per user message, prune and size caps, and explicit `core.autocrlf=false`,
  `core.longpaths=true`, `core.symlinks=true`, `core.quotepath=false`. The
  user's own git state is never touched. This is not just a nicer `/undo`: only
  `write_file` and `patch_file` call `Backup`, so **deletions and renames made
  by `execute_command` are currently unrecoverable**. Snapshot the job worktree
  rather than the parent, or a job commit captures unrelated foreground edits.
- Refuse stale writes. Nothing records when the model last read a file, so
  `write_file` silently clobbers a concurrent formatter, a rebase, or a second
  agent in the same worktree. Record `(path, mtime, size, hash)` per session on
  read and refuse a write with "re-read first". Key it off the existing session
  store; do not add a database for it. Local backends only in v1, and say so
  when it is skipped for remote ones.
- Add an LSP client. ~~The more valuable half — run diagnostics after every
  edit and append them to the tool result, so the model learns it broke the
  build without being told~~ — **shipped 2026-09-03** for Go, syntax-only, on
  the existing zero-dependency path. Nothing shells out and there is no opt-in
  to make it: running `go build` behind a write would execute an unapproved
  command on every edit, which is what `execute_command`'s permission gate
  exists to prevent, and the only importer that resolves real types invokes the
  `go` command itself, so type checking is the same shell-out renamed. Errors
  the file already had are excluded, because blaming the model for pre-existing
  breakage sends it editing code nobody asked it to touch. Bounded to the
  edited file, 250 ms, ten items, 2 KB; non-Go files add nothing at all.
  `behavior.post_edit_diagnostics_disabled` turns it off.
  What an LSP layer would add on top is **type** diagnostics and non-Go
  languages — the syntax check catches a broken edit, not a wrong one.
  `code_intelligence.go` stays as the zero-dependency Go fast path; LSP layers
  above it and must degrade silently when no server is installed.
  **Import `github.com/charmbracelet/x/powernap`** (MIT, `go 1.24`, two pure-Go
  deps) rather than hand-rolling: it carries 388 KB of generated protocol
  bindings and a 372-server config table. The stdlib-only rule is scoped to LLM
  provider and MCP wire code, where hand-rolling is the differentiator; it does
  not reach a published protocol with standard generated bindings. Two caveats:
  `mitchellh/mapstructure` is archived upstream, and `pkg/lsp/protocol` ships
  its own nested licence (gopls-derived) needing its own notice entry.
  **Skip `lsp_rename`/`lsp_replace_symbol` in v1** — LSP-driven mutation
  bypasses the diff preview, the backup call, and the approval renderer.
- Add background shell jobs with output and kill tools. `execute_command` is
  synchronous with a hard 10-minute timeout, so there is no way to start a dev
  server, watcher, or long build and keep working. Compatible with the no-PTY
  contract — a detached process with piped output is not a PTY. `job_kill` must
  be scoped to jobs this session started, never arbitrary pids.
- Evaluate an in-process POSIX shell (`mvdan.cc/sh`, BSD-3) with Go coreutils on
  Windows, replacing the `sh -c` / `cmd /C` wrapper. It would retire the
  per-host capability string currently baked into the tool description, and
  routing the interpreter's exec/open/stat handlers through
  `RuntimeBackend.Resolve` would give `execute_command` **root confinement for
  builtins for the first time** — today only `cwd` is confined and the command
  itself can read anything. Three things must be settled first: persistent shell
  state invalidates the approved command string (ship without it, or render the
  effective env/cwd delta in the approval prompt); in-process builtins are not
  killable by `procrun`, which assumes a separate OS process, so a tight loop
  becomes an unkillable goroutine; and the whole permission suite must be
  re-validated against the new execution path. Start with the handler stack, not
  a coreutils reimplementation. Do this **after** the cheaper items above.
- Add a reusable **process-group handle** before background shell jobs or an
  in-process shell: one containment boundary that multiple `exec.Cmd`s can join
  so a pipeline is not split across unrelated trees. The earlier tracked-
  process gaps are closed: POSIX release sweeps the process group, local
  `execute_command` participates in containment, and cancellation returns
  structured mechanism/confirmation/survivor evidence. SSH remains explicitly
  unconfirmed because it has no remote process-group mechanism.
- Expose `doctor` as a read-only self-diagnostic tool. `buildDoctorReport`
  already emits a versioned structured report with redaction, so this is a thin
  adapter that turns "it's broken" into a self-diagnosing session. Move the
  checks out of `cmd/` first — `internal/doctor/` is an empty directory — and
  give the model-facing surface its own redaction test.
- ~~Add skills: an `<available_skills>` index with a `skill` tool that loads a
  body on demand.~~ **Shipped 2026-08-30.** The index, the read-only tool, and
  the five embedded builtins landed as specified, then grew three things this
  entry did not ask for. `disable-model-invocation` and `user-invocable` decide
  who may load a skill, enforced at the index *and* at the tool, because
  omitting a skill from the index stops the model being told about it and does
  not stop the model naming one the user mentioned. `/<skill-name>` expands a
  user-invocable skill as text, matching Claude Code; the transcript shows the
  verb while the model gets the framed body. And discovery now reads
  `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` at both scopes.
  That last one reverses this entry's "leave remote skill discovery out of v1",
  and needed a gate to be safe: a repository's foreign-layout skills are
  discovered, listed, and inert until `/skills allow <name>`, with approval
  bound to workspace and body digest so a rewritten skill is asked about again.
  Scope precedence was also inverted to user > project > builtin — only one
  direction of that choice has a victim, and it is the one where cloning a
  hostile repo replaces the `deploy` skill you wrote for yourself with one you
  have never read. Claude Code orders it the same way.
- Move tool prompts and the system prompt out of Go string literals into
  embedded files, so prompt changes are reviewable in diffs. The system prompt
  first, since it has two call sites. Write our own text.

### Skill ecosystem gaps — found 2026-08-30

**Every count in this section was re-measured on 2026-08-30 by reading each
file.** The original figures came from a research pass that mixed two
populations: the 37 top-level skills packetcode discovers under
`~/.agents/skills`, and the 28 under `~/.claude/plugins`, which it does not
load. Three entries were wrong as first written. The table below is the
measured state of the loaded population; anything not listed is zero there.

| Feature | Loaded (37) | Plugins (28) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Block-scalar `description` | 22 | 0 |
| `allowed-tools` | 3 | 7 |

The 22 block-scalar descriptions are the reason that fix mattered: before it,
those skills loaded with `">-"` as their entire index entry.


Measured against the 37 skills in one real `~/.agents/skills`, and against the
published [Claude Code skills docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) and
[Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification). Published skills now
*load* here; not all of them *work*. Ordered by how often each bites.

- ~~Substitute `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` in skill bodies and resources.~~
  **Done 2026-08-30.** Expanded at render, in `Block` and `ResourceBlock`, so
  the stored body still matches the bytes on disk and only what reaches the
  model is rewritten. Before defanging, not after: the substituted text is a
  filesystem path, `<` is legal in a POSIX path, and expanding after the pass
  that neutralises markers would let a directory name forge the block boundary.
  Builtins are excluded — their `Dir` is inside the embedded filesystem, so
  substituting would swap one unusable path for a plausible-looking one.
  **The counts in the first version of this entry were wrong.** They said "5 of
  37" and called it the highest-frequency real breakage. Re-measured:
  `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` appears in zero files across `~/.agents/skills`,
  `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.claude/plugins`. The 5-of-28 figure was for
  `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in a different population, and I merged the two when
  writing the entry up. Nothing was broken by this; it is done because it is
  cheap and correct for any skill that does use it.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is a separate question and probably a no. It resolves
  to the root of a plugin bundle, and packetcode has no plugin bundles:
  `docs/plugins.md` is explicit that the plugin model is declarative (MCP
  servers, custom providers, skills) with no in-process plugin runtime. The 27
  files using it here all live under `~/.claude/plugins`, which packetcode does
  not discover. Mapping it to the skill directory would be inventing a meaning
  the ecosystem does not give it; leaving it literal is at least honest. Revisit
  only if plugin-bundle discovery is ever added.
- ~~Decide whether to read `allowed-tools` from skill frontmatter.~~
  **Done 2026-08-30, bounded.** Counts corrected twice, which is the useful part
  of this entry's history. The original "10 of 37" merged two populations. My
  first re-measure then said "none of the 37", which was also wrong — piping an
  array of paths to PowerShell's `Select-String` searches the strings, not the
  files. Measured a third time, from Python, reading each file:
  **3 of the 37 skills packetcode loads set `allowed-tools`** — `companion-clis`,
  `runpod-mcp`, `runpodctl` — and 7 of the 28 in `~/.claude/plugins` do.
  All three loaded ones use `Bash(cmd:*)`, so in practice they grant nothing
  here twice over: the argument-scoped form is refused, and `Bash` is not a
  packetcode tool name. That is the correct outcome, and it is the case the
  implementation was built for even when the count said it could not happen.
- ~~Decide on `` !`command` `` dynamic context injection.~~ **Half shipped
  2026-08-30.** Execution is still refused, and that stays the position: it runs
  shell text out of a skill body before the model sees the result, and upstream
  ships `disableSkillShellExecution` for the same concern. What was not
  defensible was the silence — the backticked command was passed through
  verbatim, so the model was told ``PR diff: !`gh pr diff` `` and read it as a
  filled slot. `skills.BodyNotes` now detects the syntax and states, beneath the
  block, that nothing ran and no output is present. Measured 0 of the 37 loaded
  skills and 0 of their 672 resource files, so it costs the current population
  nothing; the original "1 of 37" was a `~/.claude/plugins` skill counted
  against the wrong population. Actually executing it remains open, and Claude
  Code's own `/commit` is built on it, so it will come up again.
- ~~Support indexed `$0`/`$1` arguments.~~ **Half shipped 2026-08-30**, same
  shape as the entry above: substitution is not implemented, but an unfilled
  `$1` is now reported rather than left to read as a value someone supplied.
  Scoped by measurement, not by taste. A first version annotated 23 of the
  author's installed files and every one was wrong — shell scripts whose `$1` is
  a shell positional parameter, Hyperdrive docs whose `$1` is a SQL bind
  parameter, capacity notes priced in dollars. So the check now runs on bodies
  only (a resource is never expanded with arguments, so the note has nothing
  true to say about one) and skips fenced and inline code. Re-measured at 0 of
  37 bodies and 0 of 672 resources.
  Still open: an `arguments:` frontmatter list, and substitution itself. 1
  loaded skill uses plain `$ARGUMENTS`, which already works. One accepted
  over-match remains and is asserted in the tests — a bare `$5` in prose is
  indistinguishable from a placeholder, and upstream resolves that ambiguity by
  substituting anyway.
- Accept skills packetcode currently refuses. **Measured: 0 of the 37 loaded
  skills are refused today** — none lack a `description`, none exceed
  `MaxDescriptionBytes`, none exceed `MaxBodyBytes`. One of the 28 plugin skills
  has no description. The block-scalar case, which the original entry called
  theoretical at "0/28", was in fact 22 of the 37 loaded skills, and is fixed.
  What remains is a policy question with no current victims: upstream loads a
  skill with no `description` by falling back to the first paragraph, and
  truncates an oversized one rather than dropping it, while packetcode refuses
  both. A published skill that works everywhere else and vanishes here reads as
  packetcode being broken. The caps exist for real reasons — decide which are
  worth a refusal and which should degrade.
- Decide whether a repository's own `.packetcode/skills` should need the
  approval a `.claude/skills` one now does. Today it does not: the 2026-08-30
  gate exists to avoid opening a *new* automatic-loading surface across every
  repo that already ships `.claude/skills`, not to fence off a directory
  existing projects depend on. That leaves the gate looking like a general
  project-skill trust boundary when it is not — a hostile repo can still use
  the native layout. Tightening it breaks existing projects, so it needs to be
  a decision rather than a drift.
- Offer user-invocable skills through the ACP command catalogue. The ACP server
  already exposes Markdown prompt commands through `_packetcode/commands/list`
  and expands them in `session/prompt`; this remaining item is specifically
  about skills. It is blocked on the
  wire vocabulary: `CommandInfo.Source` is a closed `builtin`/`user`/`project`
  set that clients group menus by, and a builtin skill would arrive as a
  `builtin` entry — the one thing that catalogue promises never to emit.
  Extending the protocol comes first; `ListCommands` passes nil skills until
  then, so an ACP client's menu is missing verbs the TUI has.
- Reconsider commands-vs-skills precedence. packetcode gives a name collision
  to `commands/<name>.md`; Claude Code gives it to the skill. Deliberate, and
  marked as a divergence in the README rather than presented as the ecosystem
  rule — but a project carrying both resolves `/name` differently here than
  upstream, which is exactly the surprise a porting user cannot debug.

## MCP and Extensions

- Implement Streamable HTTP MCP against the approved
  [`packetcode-mcp-http-trust-v1`](docs/mcp-http-trust-contract.md) contract and
  existing fail-closed validator. Do not add a second policy or weaken exact
  origin/address, redirect, credential, provenance, approval, or reconnect
  rules.
- Add MCP resources/prompts only after their context and trust model is defined.
  **Split ruled 2026-08-14: resources yes, prompts no.** A resource can be
  delivered by a tool returning bounded tool-role content with the trust
  contract's labelled-untrusted-boundary treatment. An MCP *prompt* is
  server-supplied text intended to become a conversation message, and
  auto-injecting it is exactly what that contract forbids; the only safe shape
  is a slash command that inserts the text into the user's input buffer for a
  human to read and send. Both halves are stdio-only and neither weakens the
  contract.
- Do not scope MCP OAuth inside the Streamable HTTP work. It needs HTTP
  transport, adds a third credential mode beyond `none`/`bearer-env`, and a
  callback server is an **inbound listener** in an executable whose trust
  contract states it adds no network listener. It needs its own contract
  amendment covering token storage, refresh, and loopback redirect-URI binding.
- Add a declarative pack manifest and install/list/enable workflow for prompt commands, MCP, hooks, themes, and workflows.
- Surface MCP timeout, crash, and reconnect details consistently in transcripts and Agent View.

## Providers and Local Models

- Add sanctioned subscription-backed providers only when the provider publishes
  and supports a third-party integration path; otherwise use API-key providers.
  **GitHub Copilot parked until after v1** (ruled 2026-08-14). The engineering
  is largely done — `sugar_login.go` is a working, security-tested OAuth device
  grant and `codexauth.go` does refresh-token exchange with atomic write-back —
  so this is blocked only on a written answer to whether Copilot's published
  integration path sanctions a third-party terminal agent. Reputational risk,
  not technical.
- Expand Ollama pull progress, cancellation, and model-removal management.
- Add optional MLX/local-runtime backends only if they can match the native tool
  and streaming contracts without weakening Ollama's zero-config path. LM
  Studio, llama.cpp, and LiteLLM are already usable through the `custom`
  provider; the missing half is zero-config discovery — probe the well-known
  ports and register what answers, reusing Ollama's existing capability
  enrichment. The constraint above is the trap: a server that advertises tool
  support but mangles parallel tool calls is worse than no discovery, because it
  silently degrades a working setup. Gate on a real capability probe, default
  tool support to false when unverified, put discovery behind an opt-in config
  key so a stray listener cannot hijack a provider list, and use a short client
  timeout so a dead endpoint cannot delay startup. One file per runtime; ship LM
  Studio first and stop if it does not earn its keep.
- Add provider-specific output/reasoning controls to the model picker when the upstream catalog exposes them.
- Verify the MiniMax reasoning wire shape against a live key. The inline
  `<think>` path is implemented from the published tool-use guide, not from an
  observed response; confirm it, then decide whether to adopt
  `reasoning_split=true` + verbatim `reasoning_details` echo instead of
  reconstructing the tags.
- Track MiniMax cached-input and long-context billing. `/cost` currently bills
  M3 at a flat $0.30/$1.20: cached input reads are cheaper, and a request over
  512K tokens bills entirely at the 2x long-context tier, so long sessions on a
  1M window are under-reported. Needs `usage` cache fields parsed into
  `provider.Usage` and a tiered entry in the MiniMax pricing table.
- Map `/effort` onto MiniMax `thinking.type=disabled` so thinking can be turned
  off for cheap turns; MiniMax does not implement `ReasoningEffortController`.
- Evaluate `api.minimax.io/anthropic` as an alternate MiniMax transport, where
  thinking blocks are first-class and the existing Anthropic parser already
  handles them. Trade-off: MiniMax stops sharing `openaicompat`.

## Packet Computers

Product source: [PACKETCOMPUTERS.md](PACKETCOMPUTERS.md). Bounded Phase 1
ledger: [docs/packet-computers-loop.md](docs/packet-computers-loop.md)
(PCMP1–PCMP10; PCMP9 cut 2026-08-14). PCMP1/PCMP2 shipped 2026-07-31. PCMP3 and a bounded foreground
direct-SSH backend shipped 2026-08-01: pinned persistent SSH/SFTP plus
root-confined core tools via `packetcode --computer <name>`.

- PCMP4/PCMP5 — daemon RPC plus heartbeat, so status stops being a stored value
  and becomes a probed one. **Scope ruled 2026-08-14: the daemon is
  session-scoped.** It exists to reach Packet Computers and dies with the app;
  it holds no durable job state (see the PCMP9 ruling above).
- **Ledger edit needed before PCMP4 starts:** replace the `--listen
  127.0.0.1:<port>` acceptance condition with an AF_UNIX socket on POSIX and a
  named pipe (or stdlib AF_UNIX) on Windows. PCMP4 carries two conditions —
  refuse non-loopback binds *and* write no credentials to disk — and loopback
  TCP is reachable by every local UID, so satisfying the first that way forces
  an auth token that breaks the second. A socket at `0600` inside a `0700`
  directory gets both from filesystem permissions and makes the loopback rule
  structural rather than a validation check a config path or `--network host`
  can regress. There is no network listener anywhere in production code today,
  so nothing is being migrated. Carry two caveats: SSH forwarding needs
  `AllowStreamLocalForwarding` on the remote sshd and must fail with a clear
  diagnostic rather than a hang; and try stdlib AF_UNIX on Windows before
  reaching for `go-winio`.
- Add a data-dir advisory lock holding pid, start time, and workspace root.
  Cross-project clobbering is fixed (job records now carry their owning project
  root), but two instances rooted at the *same* project still cannot be told
  apart, and a daemon sharing the jobs directory makes that case reachable.
  Share one vocabulary across the lock, stale-socket classification, and the
  `abandoned` state — all three are the same three-way "running / died / owned
  by someone else" question.
- Finish PCMP6/PCMP7 daemon parity: the foreground direct-SSH backend now
  supplies host verification and `RuntimeBackend` for core tools, but the
  planned SSH-forwarded daemon transport, backend parity suite, and remote code
  intelligence remain open. "Reconnect semantics" here means recovering a
  dropped transport *within* one session — reconnect after the app exits is out
  of scope per the PCMP9 ruling.
- PCMP8 direct-SSH routing shipped 2026-08-02: immutable computer/root binding,
  `/spawn --computer <name>`, whole-workflow placement, independent per-job
  SSH connections, and fail-closed remote Git worktrees. **PCMP9 is cut** — see
  the ruling under Agents, Loops, and Workflows. PCH4's rule stands and is now
  the only rule: anything not genuinely resumed is reported as abandoned.
- ~~Add an explicit `abandoned` terminal state so a loss is never flattened into
  a confirmed cancellation.~~ **Shipped 2026-08-14 as PCMP10.** `StateAbandoned`
  plus an `AbandonCause` (`app-exit` / `transport-lost` / `unknown`), and a
  durable `CancelRequest` stamped before the context is cancelled — without it a
  user cancel and a dead transport are the same `context.Canceled`. A running
  job left by an unclean exit now reconciles as abandoned; a queued one stays
  cancelled, because it provably never started. Five sites that treated any
  unrecognised terminal state as a **success** were fixed at the same time (two
  workflow gates, `spawn_agent`, `collect_agent_results`, Agent View grouping);
  they now test `State.IsSuccess()` instead of enumerating failures.
- **Still open from PCMP10: remote cancellation evidence.** Local teardown now
  reports the mechanism, whether containment was confirmed, and surviving PIDs;
  POSIX process groups and Windows Job Objects are both covered. SSH can only
  signal the channel leader and therefore always reports unconfirmed teardown;
  there is no remote process-group mechanism or evidence path yet. Until that
  exists, `transport-lost` is claimed only where a transport error was actually
  observed.
- Add a generation-aware SSH connection manager only with a no-replay rule for
  writes/commands; current jobs intentionally own independent connections.
- Add asynchronous remote project workflow discovery and an explicit
  workflow-scoped shared-worktree contract. Today write steps are isolated and
  exchange summaries, not unmerged filesystem state.
- Defer managed cloud machines, snapshots, and process supervision until the
  local/SSH contracts are stable.

## Packet Control

**Split to PacketADE 2026-07-31.** Packet Control Phases 1–2 are implemented
in PacketADE (`D:\projects\PacketADE\dev\packet-control-loop.md`, CTL1–CTL9),
because evidence bundles need a viewer and PacketADE already has the diff,
review-gate, and Flight surfaces to show them in. See
[PACKETCOMPUTERS.md](PACKETCOMPUTERS.md) for the product definition.

- No packetcode work is scheduled. If Control is later wanted in the TUI, it
  must consume CTL1's manifest schema rather than defining a second evidence
  format.

## Security and Trust

- Define shared policy axes for filesystem, shell, network, MCP, browser, desktop, secrets, and remote computers.
- Add redaction tests for provider errors, hooks, statuslines, job artifacts,
  and future control evidence. MCP log and future remote-output redaction are
  covered by the PCH5 suite.
- Add audit events for live permission-mode changes and remembered approvals.
- Keep Bypass Permissions explicit, visible, outside the normal Shift+Tab cycle, and subordinate to deny rules.
- Treat remote/browser/desktop content as untrusted evidence rather than instructions.
- Decide whether `ask` command-prefix rules should hold across compound
  commands. The deny direction was fixed 2026-08-14, but the same
  allow-direction refusal still applies to `ask` rules, so under a permissive
  profile `git status; :` falls through to allow where `git status` would
  prompt. Lower severity than the deny bypass and currently pinned by
  `TestPolicy_CommandPrefixMatchesFields`, so changing it is a deliberate
  decision rather than a bug fix.
- Add substring or regex command matching to permission rules. Today there is
  only exact `command` and `command_prefix`, which is a narrow vocabulary for
  expressing "never run this".
- Collapse the two filesystem-confinement implementations.
  `internal/tools/safefs.go` is largely superseded by
  `internal/computers/local_backend.go`, which every core tool actually routes
  through, and their semantics differ slightly. Two jails with one purpose is a
  place for a gap to hide.
- Widen the hook matcher from exact-tool-name-or-`*` to globs, reusing
  `permissions.toolPatternMatches` so hooks and permission rules share one
  pattern language.
- Consider hook verdicts beyond block and context injection — rewrite tool
  input and auto-approve. **Sequencing is the security design:** `PreToolUse`
  currently fires *after* the policy decision, so a rewrite bolted onto that
  call site would be evaluated against no policy at all. Move the hook above
  the first `Decide`, keep deny as an absolute floor over any hook verdict, make
  both mutating verdicts opt-in per hook, and assert that a rewrite lands before
  the approval prompt renders.

## PacketADE Integration and BridgeCode-Plus

Approved 2026-07-27. The cross-repository source of truth is
`D:\projects\PacketADE\dev\bridgemind\packetcode-bridgecode-loop.md` (PC1–PC10).
The evidence audit and bounded follow-up ledger are
[`docs/bridgecode-feature-truth-2026-07-27.md`](docs/bridgecode-feature-truth-2026-07-27.md)
and
[`docs/bridgecode-plus-hardening-loop-2026-07-27.md`](docs/bridgecode-plus-hardening-loop-2026-07-27.md).

- Complete the signed clean-machine release matrix and packaged PacketADE
  compatibility gates when published artifacts/runners exist.
- Consume PacketAgent's versioned durable-handoff contract when that sibling
  runtime publishes it; do not create a competing PacketCode daemon contract.
- Preserve PacketCode as an independently installable product; durable execution
  after its originating app closes belongs to PacketAgent. **This line governs
  (ruled 2026-08-14):** it was in tension with PCMP4/5/9, which committed to a
  packetcode daemon retaining job state across a restart. The tension is
  resolved in favour of this rule — PCMP9 is cut and the daemon is
  session-scoped. See Agents, Loops, and Workflows.
