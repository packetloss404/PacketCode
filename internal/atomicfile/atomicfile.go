// Package atomicfile writes a file so that a crash leaves either the previous
// contents or the new ones, never a mixture and never an empty file.
//
// Both internal/session and internal/jobs already wrote through a temp file and
// a rename, and both called that "atomic". Rename is atomic for *visibility* —
// a reader sees one name or the other, never a half-written one — but without
// an fsync the rename can reach the disk before the data it points at. A crash
// in that window leaves a file that exists, has the right name, and contains
// nothing. For a session that is the conversation; for a job record it is the
// state a restart reconciles from.
//
// So the claim was half true, in the half that is easy to test and not the half
// that matters when the machine loses power.
